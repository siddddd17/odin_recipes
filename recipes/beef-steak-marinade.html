        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is just an excellent beef steak marinade that adds juiciness and flavour into steaks, transforming economical steaks from just ok to “wow!”. It injects extra flavour without overpowering the natural flavour of beef, and makes the meat tender.</p>
        <p>It’s actually easy to make marinades that infuse flavour into steaks. But it’s harder to make marinades that enhance without adding too much flavour into the steak. You want the steak to taste mainly of (gasp, shock horror!) BEEF. Not overwhelmed by marinade flavour!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together mustard, garlic and onion powder. Then mix in remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place beef in a ziplock bag with Marinade and marinade overnight (12 - 24 hours).</li>
            <li>Remove from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature - key for even cooking of steaks. Shake off excess marinade.</li>
            <li>Brush BBQ Grills with oil, then heat on high heat until is really hot - you should see wisps of smoke. Or heat a heavy based skillet on high until very hot, then add oil - it will heat almost instantly.</li>
            <li>Add steaks. For 2cm / 3/4" thick steaks, cook the first side for 2 minutes, then turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes (medium rare 52°C/125°F, chart below for other doneness temps). (Note 3)</li>
            <li>Remove from skillet onto a WARM plate, cover loosely with foil and set aside for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve!</li>
        </ol>
