        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is just an excellent beef steak marinade that adds juiciness and flavour into steaks, transforming economical steaks from just ok to “wow!”. It injects extra flavour without overpowering the natural flavour of beef, and makes the meat tender.</p>
        <p>It’s actually easy to make marinades that infuse flavour into steaks. But it’s harder to make marinades that enhance without adding too much flavour into the steak. You want the steak to taste mainly of (gasp, shock horror!) BEEF. Not overwhelmed by marinade flavour!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp minced garlic</li>

            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
